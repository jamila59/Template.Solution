## Description

A C# program where the user is given the option to view all vendors or to add new vendors. When the user selects the "Add a new Vendor" option he or she is directed to a form where they are asked to enter a vendor name. After, they are directed to another page which allows the user to select their vendor. Once the user has clicked on their vendor, the user displayed another form for filling out order descriptions. Once submitted, he or she is redirected to a page where they are able to click on orders and be directed to a separate page which displays both vendor and order details.
